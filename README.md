# Multi-dimensional-knapsack-problem based on C programming language.

Coursework from Artificial Intelligence Methods module in UNNC.

Completed in Apr 2020.

Multi-dimensional knapsack problem is a classic NP-Hard combinatorial optimisition problem used to test the performance metaheuristics.

Using Memetic Algorithm (a variant of genetic algorithm) to solve this Multi-dimentional Knapsack Problem.

The result of my Memetic Algorithm obtained only 0.5% gap in comparison with the best result in the literature.
